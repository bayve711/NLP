The platform enables the classification of text excerpts, extracted from news and reports into a set of domain specific classes.

The target words of each source word are also selected by you and should cover various levels of semantic relations – according to your linguistic judgement – to the source word, namely from highly-related to not related at all.

An inefficient way (which should be avoided!) would be looping over the set of vectors in the word embedding model, and one by one calculating the cosine/dot product similarity of the source vector to each of the target vectors. As a hint for an efficient way, consider that in `numpy` (and other libraries), calculating the dot product of a vector to a matrix is much faster than the dot products of the vector to each vector of the matrix.\n",
